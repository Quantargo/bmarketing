# bmarketing

The goal of bmarketing is to provide functions useful for data cleansing, modelling and reporting tasks.

## Installation

You can install the released version of bmarketing from [Github](https://github.com/BalintKomjati/bmarketing) with: 

```{r echo=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("BalintKomjati/bmarketing")
library(bmarketing)
```

## Example

This is a basic workflow for package usage is the following:

1) Import the package

```{r}
library(bmarketing)
```

2) Import the data you want to analyse. Like

```{r}
bmarketing <- read.csv2("inst/bmarketing.csv",dec = ".")
```

3) Do some data cleansing with function clean()

```{r}
bmarketing <- clean(x = bmarketing, t = "y")
```

4) Fit a Decision Tree, plot the results, give predictions:

```{r}
dt_model <- fitModel(data = bmarketing, y = 'y', modelType = 'DecisionTree')
rpart.plot(dt_model)

predictions <- predictByModel(data = bmarketing, model2Predict = dt_model, modelType = "DecisionTree")
```

5) Finally, you can create a report for model performance:
```{r}
results <- calcPerformance(y = bmarketing$y, y_pred = predictions)
```
